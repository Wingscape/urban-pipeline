# Urban Pipeline
This repository contains the code behind the End-to-End Urban Data Pipeline: CRISP-DM with Snowflake, dbt, and Airflow project. The goal of this project is to analyze urban expansion, air quality trends, and traffic patterns using a data-driven approach.

Following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, we integrate diverse datasets from authoritative sources like the World Bank and OpenAQ to uncover meaningful insights. The dataset focuses specifically on Indonesia.

For details on our data analysis approach, check out the Data Understanding section in the article, which includes a Google Colab notebook. You can also access it directly here: [Google Colab Notebook](https://gist.github.com/Wingscape/e475abab0ea4d00bfaceec734685062d).
